<h1>Favorite Sports and Color</h1>

    My favorite color is the color Green as you can see from the <br>
    web page background. My favorite sport is Basketball. My favorite NBA team is the Chicago Bulls. The image below
    shows one of my favorite basketball players.<br>

    Here is a way to go to the NBA's website. <a href="https://www.nba.com/#/">NBA website.</a><!-- code is from W3schools.https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figcaption.asp --> <br>
    I also like watching American Football, however I don't play it.<br>
    My favorite NFL team is the Chicago Bears. </p>
